# ComE+
Implementation of the paper
**Using Temporal Node Embeddings for Community Detection** (2024)
which combines the ComE framework established by Cavallari et al. (2017) with dynamic CTDNE-based search developed by Nguyen et al. (2018).

The implementation is based on Python 3.6.1 and Cython 0.25.

The core algorithm is only written in Cython, so a miniconda environment file is required to run the program.
